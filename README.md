# The virtual basketball-shooting machine
	This repository provides code and solutions for a virtual basketball-shooting machine which is an example of Experience Learning algorithms. The experience learning of basketball-shooting machine is realized by a python program (gradient_descent_eperience.py) and a matlab program(experiencenihe.m).
