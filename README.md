# The virtual basketball-shooting machine
This repository provides code and solutions for a virtual basketball-shooting machine which is an example of Experience Learning algorithms. The experience learning of basketball-shooting machine is realized by a python program (gradient_descent_eperience.py) and a matlab program(experiencenihe.m). These are meant to exhibit the advantages of experiential learning.

 # Environment
python 3.7
numpy 1.21.5
xlwt 1.3.0
matlab R2014a

# Python program (gradient_descent_eperience.py)
In this program, the virtual basketball-shooting machine model is given. 
D=âˆš((SS-100)^2+(HA^2)/(0.2^2 )+((PA-45)^2)/(0.2^2 ))	
In order to simulate the random error and quantization error in practice, errors are superimposed to the three parameters of the virtual basketball-shooting machine in the program.
This model is then detected using a conventional gradient descent algorithm. 
It can be seen that traditional methods are difficult to find the optimal shooting parameters due to the errors.
According to experience learning, the test parameters and corresponding results of each time are recorded and stored in the experience chain table.

#  Matlab program(experiencenihe.m)
According to the theory of experience learning, the hit rate of each detection is calculated as experience. The probability distribution of the basketball-shooting machine can be fitted based on experience of multiple iterations. Then the accurate shooting parameters can be found from the probability distribution, so as to mitigate the impact of errors.

# Data(gradient_descent.csv)
The data set is the test results from an experiment trained using gradient descent(gradient_descent_eperience.py). After that, part of this set of data is used to perform experience learning fitting in matlab program.
